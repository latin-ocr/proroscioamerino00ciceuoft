PREFACE

——..-

IN the compilation of this edition I have con-
sulted the editions of Stout, Stock‚ Donkin
and Nic'ol„ to au of whom ‘1 am indebted in

varying degreeS. I should also like to express my
appreciation of the kindly counsel and accurate
Latin scholarship of my eolleague,> W. N. Harper,
Esq.‚ who has helped me whenever I have chosen
to take my difficulties to himss The life of Cicero
was written by Jenkins ThomaS, Esq. for a selection ,
from De Senectute previously issued in this series, and
is printed by his consent. ’ Owing to the soarcity of
paper and exigencies of time, I have had to pass over
some points which Ι might otherwise have commented
on, and curtailed some of the notes to a degree which
may have impaired their lucidity.
