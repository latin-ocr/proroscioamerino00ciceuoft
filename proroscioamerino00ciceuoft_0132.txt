112 PRO SEX. ROSCIO

qui postulabant] Scipio and Metellus. Cf. cap. XXVIII„ 577.
· res ipsa] “ the request itseH, the mere demand.''
integerrimi] “most unblemishedss'

putantur] the present is necessary to show that this is still
the opinion of the Roman people ; or this clause may be treated

as parenthetical.

nemo esset] the inperi'. subj. does double duty (1) consecutive
“ so that . . . . '' and (2) hypothetical, “ there would have been.'’
We might have expected the periphrasis ‘⁴ futurus fuerit '' here.

dum . . . quaereretur] “ provided an inquiry into his father's
death might be held.”

cum occiditur] purely temporal, ‘⁸ at the time of the murder.‘'
quod , . . video] subject of suspiciosum est.

perniciosum] “ damaging, detrimental.”

ita, credo] ironical, ‘⁴ quite so, of course ! ''

ducitur] “ is charmed with their culture and refinement.’'
puerulos] ‘¹ pages ”—often musical or well-educated.

paene operarios] “ little better than labourers.''

verisimile ut] this construction, instead of the acc. and
infin„ is confined to negative or quasi-negative clauses.

non, ut] “ nor that he had found out their skill and reliability
on the work of the estate.''

GAP. XLII.

Argument. I do not say Ι suspect Chrysogonus of the
murder but I do say his influence is prejudicial to the state

and should be diminished.

omnia convenire] lit. “ all things do not apply to all men,''
i.e.‚ there are exceptions. Trans, “ I do not believe one man is

to be blamed for everything.”

distribuisse] “you remember that I divided.'' Usually
memini is followed by the pres. infin. even of a past event
when the subject witnessed it. Here the perf. infin. lays
stress on the occurrence of the fact 1n the past.

ln crimen et ln audaciam]“ to a refutation of the charge and
a protest against the effrontery of.

This division of the case occupies much of Cap. XIII„ e. g.
(a) the crimen (b) the audacia os the Roscii (c) the undue
influence of Chrysogonus.
