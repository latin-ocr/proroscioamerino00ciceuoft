CAP. XXIII.

Argument. It is said that a certain T. Caelius who had
occupied the same bedroom as his two grown-up sons was found
in the morning with his throat cut. Yet as the sons were found
asleep they were acquitted of parricide on the ground that no
human being could go to sleep after committing such a crime.
