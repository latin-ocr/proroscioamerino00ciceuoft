CAP. V.

Argument. This trial is of immense importance not only to-
Roscius but to the communsty, for unless you put a stop to such
lawless proceedings, no place will be saie—not even a court of
law. Consider the positions of accuser and accused. The
former has already seized Roscius’ property and benefitted
by his father's death, the latter is penniless and almost defence-
less. Let me give you a summary of the case.

ι &filiis Sao severa] “ strict and impartial.’' Cf. severitatem
in ., .

’ longo intervallo] ‘¹ after a long interval.” During the
Ξνέἒθνζὲξὶἓὲᾰ under the Sullan regime these courts had been

inter sicarios . . . . committitur] “ this is the first trial for·
murder that has been set up,’' i.e. under the Lex Cornelia de-
sicariis et veneficiis (81 B.C.), which took cognizance of cases
of murder, poisoning and arson. “ Inter sicarios deferre '' is
the Latin phrase for ‘⁴ to indict a person for murder.’' Before
Sulla's laW‚ special juries for the trial of murder were set up by
the people. The awkwardness of the words “ inter sicarios ’'
is due to the want of a specific Latin word for “ murder,'' for
which ‘⁴ caedes '' is not an exact equivalent.

faeta sint] gives better sense than “ factae sunt,'' for “ cum ⁹*
is obviously concessive (“ though.'')
indignissimae] “ revosting, atrocious.''

vindicationem sui] “ their means of deliverance from '¹——an

emendation for the hopeless reading of the MSS. ‘¹ dimissius ”’

· or ‘¹ dimissui.'' Another suggested reading is “ sanguini

, remedium esse ¹' which would mean “ an antidote for (daily)
bloodshed.'’

ἓθνοοὶίοηῐὶοηο] “ protest, denunciation,'' cf, vociferari, IV..

qui oausam dicimus] “ we who are on the defence.''
Cicero identifies himself with his client.

hoe cogitetis] ‘⁴ bethink yourselves, bear this in mind.”
