62 PRO SEX. ROSCIO
merely rhetorical for Roscius did not expect to get his pro- '⁷
perty back. “Caput et fortunae ’' seems to have been a

stock formula.

sexagiens] short for sexagiens centenis milibus sestertium
(abl. of price) where sestertium is gen. plu. for sestertiorum,
so that the amount was 60 times 100‚000 or 6‚000,000 sesterces
or roughly g50‚000. For amounts of a million and over this ‚⁷
was the usual abbreviation. The sesterce was equal to a little ’
more than 2d. Imagine' sums of money in English being
computed in three-penny pieces or coppersl ’

honoris eausa] ‘⁴ whom I mention with all respect.'’ What
is an honoris causa degree?

nummum]-nummorum, i.e. sestertiorum.. 2,000 sesterces
would be about ,ζ 17, though the purchasing powergof money Ι
varies in different ages.

vel] generally intensive—“ exceedingly.’' Here it is ironical
and depreciatory and ’may be translated “ perhaps.’' cf. ΙΙΙ..
§8, vel indignissimum, V111., §21 vel nobilissima XXV., §69
vel maxime and XLIII„ §124 vel maximam partem.

pecuniam] “ property‚'' not money. A reminiscence of the · ””
derivation os the word from pecus, “ cattle,'’ in whiehsswealth ⁴
primitively consisted. Cf. our “ peculiar‚’' ¹‘ fee,'' “ fellow.''

vildeatur] why subjunctive ? quoniam governs the indie. nor-
mal y.

suspicionem] “ cause for anxiety.'' Cicero means that
Chrysogonus is afraid that Roscius may disclose the shame- *
ful means by which he came into possession of his ( Roscius')
father's property.

incolumi] so long as Roscius retains his civil status. ε

obtinere] “ retain.'’ Beware of translating “ obtain.”

scrupulum] “ uneasiness '' lit. a small sharp stone in the
boot causing annoyance in walking.

se. . . . stimulat] we might having expected ‘⁴ eum ’' here, ³
but the clause is not merely a description by the speaker but
represents the inner thought of Chrysogonus. There seems
to be a mixture here of two constructions (a) qui eum stimulat,
and (b) qui se stimulet. No doubt the preceding ‘¹ sibi ’³
has unconsciously influenced “se '¹ here.

quo modo]:ut, “ as‚’' a mark of Cicero's early style.
