104 PRO SEX. ROSCIO

ignarum] “not dreaming of his (impending) fate.''

Automedontem] “ his Jehu,’' ie„ driver. Automedon was
the charioteer of Achilles

honoris sui eausa] “ out of respect for himself.''
nisi hoe]=hoe tamen, “ except that, only.''

hane suspicionem] “suspicion of this kind of thing,'¹ ite&
complicity in murder. ·

lemniscatam] lit. “ decked with coloured ribbons,'’ as a
mark of extraordinary prowess.

Roma. . . detoratur] “brought to him from Rome‚” and
therefore of all the greater merit (or demerit). Capito's
previous crimes had been committed in the provinces.

habeo dicere] “ Ι can tell of one. . . .'' A Greek construction.

quem eontra morem . . . in Tiberim deiecerit] “ whom, con-
trary to the custom of our ancestors, as he was under 60 years

old, he (Capito) pushed over into the Tiber.'’ Two customs -

seem to be here hinted at (a) In the Comitia Centuriata when
elections were held the centuries were divided into iuniores
(men between 18 and 45, i.e., of military age), and seniores
(from 46 to 60), who passed over pontes or narrow galleries in
order to reach their respective saepta or ovilia (“ polling-
booths). Men over 60 were supposed to have forfeited their
vote and if any appeared in the gangways they were sometimes
jostled out of the way as a protest by the younger men. (b)
On the 15th of May every year the Pontifices and the Vestal
Virgins threw into the Tiber 24 images of men made of rushes
and called Argei—probably a reminiscence of a time when old
rnen had actually been cast into the Tiber as a sacrifice to the
river god. Hence sexagenarios de ponte deicere passed into
a proverb meaning that men over 60 years of age had no votes,
and presumably no civic rights. The point of Cicero's grim
jest is that Capito's victim was under sixty and Capito's offence
all the more heinous. But, at the best, the jest is very feeble.
Cf„ our expression ‘¹ to make a man walk the plank.''

prodierit] “ come forward as a witness.’'
atque adeo] “ or rather,'' cf. cap. X., ξ 29.

thvgl'l'iat modo] “only let him come '’; modo—“provided ·
a .

volumen] “ roll,'’ on which Erucius had written down for

Capito’s benefit the questions he was likely to be asked and ·

the answers he was to give. “Coaching'’ or ‘¹ priming'’
witnesses is not a modern invention !
