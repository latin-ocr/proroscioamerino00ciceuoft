NOTES 63

cAP. 111.

Argument. I call upon you not to allow yourselves to become
the instruments of these unscrupulous men who, not satisfied
with robbing Roscius of his birthright, are bent upon proving
him a parricide.

sanguinem et vitam] “ our very life—blood.'' Hendiadys.

calamitatem] ‘¹ ruin.'¹

intenditur] “ aimed,” “ directed ; ’¹ metaphor of a blow
aimed at an adversary. Propulsete's, “ ward off '' keeps up the
figure of speech.

eausa criminis] “ ground for the accusation.''

, laeti suspicio] ‘¹ reason to suspect Roscius of the deed.’'
Both genitives are obj ective.

vel minima] ‘⁶ the very saintest incident.'' ‘¹ vel '' here has
its usual intensifying force. The sense of “ res '' must always
be gathered from its context.

nonnihil . . . . secuti (esse)] “to have had something at
any rate to go upon‚” sequor aliquid—“ to follow up a clue, to
have some object,'' cf. XII., §34

in nomine deierando] ‘¹ in preferring the charge.’' In these

standing commissions (quaestiones perpetuae) there were three .

preliminary stages (1) postulatio or permission to bring the
accusation (b) nominis delatio or specification of the nature
of the charge and the character of the accused (c) nominis
receptio or formal admission of the charge by the praetor.

x gnon recusamus quin] “ I have no objection to.'' ¹ As the verb
implies hindrance and is negative ‘⁴ quin '³ replaces “ quominuS.”

ut . . . ne] for the more normal ‘⁴ ne ’' alone, cf. 1., §5.

hoe . . . pugnatur] ‘⁴ hoc '⁹ is the object (adverbial) of the
impersonal verb ‘⁴ pugnatur.''

cumulus] ‘-‘ the crown, the last straw.''

eum . . . . tum]—⁴‘ et . . . . et‚’¹ “ while . . . also ’' or ‘¹ not
only . . . . but also.’'

vel] goes with “indignissimum '' not with “ hoc,’' and is
thus printed in some texts.

vos idoneos habitos] the subject of the preceding “ indigniss-

ι imum est ¹' Trans. ‘⁴ Is it not the crowning infamy that you

 

should be considered fit and proper persons by whose verdict
they should secure what they had been in the habit of secu ring
previously by criminal violence.'’
