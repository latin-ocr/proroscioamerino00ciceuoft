 

INTRODUCTION. IX

December, 43, Cicero was murdered near Formiae by a
party of ,Antonian troops

Cicero’s private character was above reproach. As a
statesman he combined marvellous skill in orat01'y‚ high
aspiratione and true desire to do right, with -an infirmity
of purpose, a latent insincerity of character, and an
incredible vanity which almost neutralised his nobler
qualities His memory has, however, been preserved
from too harsh a judgment by his literary excellence. In
his hands Latin prose reached its full splendour. “ He
created a language which remained for sixteen centuries
that of the civilised world and used that language to
create a style which nineteen centuries have not replaced
and, in some respectS‚ have scarcely altered.” (J. W.

Mackail).

Cicer-0⁵8 Works.

Of his orations, fifty-nine are in whole or part pre-
served. The most famous of them ,are the speeches
against V erres Catiline and Antonius He also wrote
(a) Treatises on RhetoriC, the best known of which is the
De Oratore ; (b) Philosophical Works‚ of which the De
Republica, De Officiis and De Natura Deorum are perhaps
the most famous t and (c) Epistles-—a very large number
of his letters to his life-long friend Atticus and otherS,
have come down to 115, and give us a complete and inti-
mate knowledge of the period in which he lived.
