NOTES Χ 97

> iudicio pertundere] “ to deal us a blow through the verdict.''
The MSS. reading is ¹‘ perfundere ” which* means ‘¹ to drench ”
or “ soak.'’ Its meaning must be gathered from “ accusare
autem '¹ to which it is to some extent a contrast. L and S
trans. perfundere by “ to alarm, to cause apprehension.''

vulgo occidebantur] “ murders were common.''

nonno cogitas . . . esse] “do you forget, do you fail to see
you have brought. . . ? '' Here ¹‘ nonne '' does not imply
“ yes '' but the non goes closely with cogitas and the ne
¹lfnairks a question. Lit. “ Do you not-think‚'’ i.e., “ can you
ai to see ? ''

sectores collorum et- bonorum.] A pun of the usual frigid sort
and almost beneath the dignity of English. In the first
case 1“ sector '' means ‘¹ cutter‚” i.e., cut—throat‚ and in the
second “ broker ¹' or buyer of confiscated property. ‘L and
S suggest “ cut-throats and cut-purses.”

concursabant] “ prowled‚ roamed about.''

ῒῂαοέῑὴίῑαξρω iniquitatem-que] ‘⁴ the cruelty and harshness of
e lmeS.

huic crimini] predicative dative, “a ‚ground of accusation
against my client.''

⁴ ingeniis. . . diffidere] “ betraying a lack of saith in your ’

intelligence . ’ ¹
dissoluta est] ‘¹ disposed of, met.''
commenticiis] “ imaginary,'’ “ fabricated.''

declamare] “ practising oratory‚'' “ spouting.’'
commutaretur] “that he might have a rehearsal. of (a

⁴ ι’ speech) against a different defendant.''

 

ita . . . pertinebant] ‘¹ so little had they to do with‚” i.e., his
remarks were so irrelevant to the main issue.

verbo] “ by mere assertion,'' i.e., not by proof.
ad testes] “ for cross-examination.’'
minsa causa] ‘⁸ in my defence,'' sc. nos repperit.

GAP. XXX»

Argument. Whereas you, Erucius, can prove no motive for
the crime in the case of Sextus, Ι can and do in the cas‘e of T.
Roscius. If ever Cassius' query ‘⁴ Who benefitted '' is applic-
able, it is in this case.

cupiditas] sc. accusandi, my desire for prosecuting.
