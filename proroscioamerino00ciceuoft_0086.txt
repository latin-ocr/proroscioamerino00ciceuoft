66 PRO SEX. ROSCIO

oo prorumpere] the pres. infin. is put purposely sor the future
to emphasise the imminence of the danger ; ‘¹ men's passions
and crime and effrontery are going to such lengths that . . . .'’

ex insidiis] the phrase is in opposition to “ hic in foro‚’' “ not
only covertly but in this very forum.’' Then Cicero dramati-
cally leads us to a climax in the words “ ante tribunal . . . ante
pedes . . . . inter ipsa subsellia,’' ,the heinousness of the deed
being emphasised by the order of the ideas.

invaserunt] “ have swooped down upon.''

quibus . . . . bono fuit] “ to whom the murder of Sex. Roscius’
father was an advantage.'' The acc. and infin. “ occidi pat—
rem '' is the subject of “ bono fuit '’ (impersonal). Note the
double or predicative dative which is constructed with “ sum‚'’
“ venire,’' “ mittere ’¹ etc. The phrase “ cui bono ’' has become
proverbial (in a different sense) but was first used by a cele·
brated tribunus plebis, L. Cassius Longinus, the introducet of
the second Lex Tabellaria ( Ballot Act) which allowed secret
voting by ballot in criminal cases. Cf. XXX.‚ §84

summe] “ pre-eminently, in the highest degreee.'’
eum praesidio] “under escort, with a bodyguard.''

poscit] ‘⁴ demands the punishment of.’' Cicero implies that
the people wished Chrysogonus to be punished.

relictus . . . restat] “the sole and only survivor.'' One of
these words is superfluous.

illorum] subjective genitive.

ut . . . facilius] “quo facilius '' would be more normal.
Either a sign of immaturity of style or to avoid the awkward
sound of “ atque quo.''

indigniora] “more disgraceful.''

Argument. My client’ s father, Sextius Roscius, was a
burgess of Ameria wealthy and of good birth, and a staunch
supporter of the aristocratic party, whose cause he espoused
in the late civil trouble (between Marius and Sulla), and with
some of the leaders of which he was on terms of the closest ln-
timacy. Unfortunately, there was a long· -standing and
bitter feud between him and his two kinsmen, bRoscius Capito
and Roscius Magnus, men of the lowest character.

municeps Amerinus]“ a 'burgess os Ameria‚’' a small country
town in Umbria, between the Tiber and the Nar, and about 50
