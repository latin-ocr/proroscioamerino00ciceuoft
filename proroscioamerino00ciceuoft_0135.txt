GAP. XLIV.

Argument. I am not hinting at Sulla but at Chrysogonus.
As the proscriptione and sales were to end on June lst, and the
murder occurred months after, either the property‘gwas never

'entered in the public accounts or these were tampered with

by false dates being inserted ; therefore the sale was illegal.

Sullam . . . purgavit] “my own words have exonerated
Sulla.'’ Vide cap. VIII., §21.

ut ementiretur] this and the other ut—clauses expand and
explain “ haec omnia '' and are equivalent to noun clauses of

apposition in English.

passus non sit] the pref. subj. among imperis. governed by
the same ut is to be explained es expressing the actual result
and not the natural or expected result. The imperfs. express
repeated acts. Again Cicero would avoid the ending non
pater-etur as being too suggestive of an hexameter line.

postea] in a part of the speech which has been lost.
esse in lego] ‘¹ it is stated in the law.''

quam ad diem] ‘¹ by what day‚'' marking the limit. ·‘ Dies '¹
meaning a fixed day or time is generally feminine.

fiant] ‘⁴ are to end.''

Kal. Iunias] June lst, ΒΟ. 81.

aliquot post menses] the abl. would have been more usual,

nulla redierunt] “ were never entered.’' “ Nulla '' is adver-
bial. “ Bona,'' of course, must mean the money accruing
from the sale of the property.

sanetius eludimur] “ more neatly tricked.”

corruptae] “ doctored, tampered with‚¹' i.e. by the insertion
of a date before June lst.

capiti mederi] “ safeguarding the vital interests of.'' Caput
is either (1) the life or (2) the civic status of Sextus.

reduviam curem] “attending to a hang-nail or whitlow‚”
i.e. a Skin affection affecting the nails. Proverbially, means

“ a mere trifle.''
laborat] “ he does not bother about the money.''
