tried, the strictest letter of the law was likely to be
insisted on and no technical points overlooked. Again
Chrysogonus was so powerful and so intimately associated
with Sulla, that it was confidently believed that no
advocate would be bold enough to reveal the shameiully
corrupt sale or the details of the plot by which Sextus
had been victimised. The counsel for the prosecution
was one Erucius, a low-born and unscrupulous man of ,
notoriously evil character, and the witnesses were
bribed to give false evidence. But Sextus was not left
quite naked to his enemies, for the nobles, feeling, no
doubt, considerable resentment at the overbearing
manners and undue influence of the upstart Chrysogonus,
were present in court to give Sextus moral support. It
is even suspected that Sulla himself was not entirely
averse to his avaricious and unpopular henchman ,
Chrysogonous meeting with a rebuff. But no really
prominent advocate would take the risk of offending
Sulla by defending Sextus, who had therefore to depend
on Cicero, a young barrister at that time comparatively
unknown. Perhaps it was a fortunate circumstance tor
Sextus, for it is almost certain that no contemporary ‚
pleader could have made so brilliant a deience as that of
the man who was soon to become the brightest exponent
of forensic eloquence that Rome ever produced. At
any rate we are told by Plutarch that Sextus was
acquitted, though it is improbable that he ever regained
his property.
