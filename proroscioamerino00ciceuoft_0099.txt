 

NOTES ’ 79

obtulerit] generic subj. with “ qui,'' cf. vocetur below. It
makes the statement or classification more general.

res postularet] “ should circumstances demand it.’'

cogebant] we might have expected ‘¹ cogerent ’¹ here, but it
seems to be brought under the heading of verbs like debeo, etc.
which already imply necessity or obligation and convey a
“potential'’ force. The idea may be thus paraphrasedff ‘If
the necessity ever arose, it would be incumbent on a son to
die instead of his fatherss' Cf. id erat XIX„ ξ 53¹ it would have

been.'' ,
singulari] ‘¹ unparalleled, unique.”

quibus tandem] “ what (in the world), what sort of argu-
ments, pray ?' tandem is ironical.

immanem]‘ ‘brutishl'

omnia. .pronigata] a very difficult phrase. Omnia
appears to be substantival, ‘his whole character utterly
abandoned and depraved.'’

obiciendi causa] “ of casting a taunt, a gibe at him,¹' i.e.‚
much less trying to prove it seriously.

GAP. xlv.

Argument. Even Roscius' enemies admit he had no homici—
dal tendencies, that he was not extravagant, in debt or
avaricious. They allege that his father did not like him,
but are utterly unable to say why, though it is quite unnatural
for a father to dislike his offspring without a cause.

qul=qualis, what sort ? cf. IX., § 25 qui vir fuerit.
inductus] “ led astray by worthless companions.''

natus maior] as natus is incapable of being put in the com-
gagaltiilxire degree, maior or minor is used with the acc. or abl.

ne (ssei quidem] ‘⁴ not ’even alleged,'' i.e.‚ much less proved.
nimirum] cf. scilicet and videlicet—ironical.

indgmitae . . . cupiditates] ‘⁴ overmastering avarice '' ; animi is
super uous.

ln convivio] interesse usually takes a dative.

habitarit. .leerit] generic subj. (consecutive). Habito is
“to dwell,'' vivo, ‘to spend one' s lifess’ the former relating to
place, the latter to time.
