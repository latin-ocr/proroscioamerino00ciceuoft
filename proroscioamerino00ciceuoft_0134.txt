114 PRO SEX. ROSCIO

qua ratione] “ on what ground.''--the principle, Cf. ξ 96.
quo mod0]‘ in what way, ''-—the means.

non ita quaeram ut dicam]‘ ‘I' will not ask this question in
such a way as to insinuate.

audaciter] this 1s an emendation for the MSS. reading audien-
tur and is quite unnecessary. Translate, ‘If these things ever
come to be known (lits ‘heard of' 'l and openly talked about,
· [then it will be realised that] Sext. Roscius was not so great a
man that we should complain about his treatment most of
all'' (potissimum) Cicero means that greater men than Sextus ,
suffered under the proscriptions.

sive Valeria sive Cornelia] The lex Cornelia de proscriptione
was not really a law but an enactment issued by Sulla on his
own authority >before he had been made dictator. The Lex
Valeria passed on the motion of L. Valerius Flaccus, interrex
B.C. 82, by the Comitia Centuriata, wa's a genuine law and, as it
enacted that ‘¹ whatever Sulla had done should have the force
of law,'' it legalised Sulla' s previous regulations contained in
the Lex Cornelia. Hence Cicero is justified in asserting his
ignorance as to which‘lex''gove1ned the proceedings in a
case of proscription.

non enim novi nee scio] ¹ for Ι am ignorant of its terms‚''
nosse—to be acquainted with, scire—to know a fact. Cf. Fr.
connaitre and savoir.

 

in adversariorum praesidiis] “ within the enemies' liness
dum . . . fuerant]“ so long as there were any lines.'’

(Ι ῐθῦθεεὶηιῗῗ] other readings are recesserunt and recessum est f}
impersona ¹

in summo otio] ‘¹ at a time of profound peace.’'
lego] sc. ,occisus est.

i
veteres leges] presumably the old law of outlawry, whereby 5
a man condemned to the penalty of “ aquae et ignis interdic- *⁴
tio '' might be killed with impunity by anybody. Sulla exten- 1
ded this law to his enemies by the Lex Cornelia. Cicero' s argu· Ἴ
ment is that the murdered man did not come under any of
these laws, as he was neither “ accursedss' nor a traitor not
proscribed
