“ Let us proceed‚ gentlemen, it is only a handful of
rebels who are being killed by my orders.’' “ Hoc

and class legislation. The assassination was carried out
as the sequel to “ proscriptions '’ or sentences of what
we should now-a—days call outlawry. Sulla ordered the
names of his enemies to be entered on whitened tablets

system remained as an instrument of oppression long
