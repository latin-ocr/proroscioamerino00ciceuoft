NOTES 69

ly brought to Roscius Capito at Ameria by a client of Roscius
Magnus Within 4 days news of the murder was conveyed
to Chrysogonus at Volaterrae and a foul plot between him
and the Roscii was set afoot.

hic] the sont, the accused person.

isto] Cicero assumes that Magnus was at Rome on the (lay
of the murder. He nowhere attempts to prove more than that
he was a frequent visitor in Rome.

assiduus] we should have expected an adverb here.

Pallacinas] the baths were a little to the N .W. of the Capitol,
near the Circus Flaminius.

spero . . . non esse] “ I expect there is no doubt?

maleficii ε objective genitive, “reason to suspect complicity
'in the foul deed.''

ros ipsa] “ the issue, the sequel.''
adfinem culpae] ‘⁸ implicated '' ,culpae is dal. or gen.

iudicatoto] the future imperative is said to have sometimes
va sort of ‘ permissive sense, “ you may, if you please, consider
ἑὲἕςέἒὲῗῗῖ ἓὴῗὲξέῃὲᾞὲῗέΐέῗᾼῌ paga XX·‘ ἓ ⁵⁷ ¹ats³¹⁵⁰te

Ameriam nuntiat] ‘⁴ brings the news to Ameria.'’ A pregnant ’
use of nuntio bringing it under verbs of. motion.

tenuis] ‘⁴ poor.'’ Cf. our “ slender means.''

libertinus] a freedman was “ libertinus ’¹ in relation to his
fellow·men, but “libertus '’ i.e. “liberatus ’' in his relation
to his master. ·

cum] “ although.''

post horam primam noetis]-110ra prima* post noctem,
⁴‘ an hour after nightfall.” The same dislocation of strict
logie occurs in the Latin for the days of the month.

primo diluculo] ‘⁴ just as daybreak began.”

horis nocturnis] the night was divided into 12 hours between
sunset and sunrise and the duration of an hour therefore varied
with the seasons.

As Cicero says that Mallius covered over 50 miles in 10
hours and travelled in great haste, his words imply that it
was summer time, when the hours would be short.

cisiis] Gallie two-wheeled vehicles used for rapid travelling.
The plural implies that he used more than one, and ‘⁴ pervola-
vit '' enforces the idea of his having “ flown along.''
