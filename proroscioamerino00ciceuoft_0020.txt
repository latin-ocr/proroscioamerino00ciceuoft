XVI THE STATE OF POLITICS

Roman juristS, intended to mark the horror with which
so unnatural an offence was regarded. Cicero in
cap. XXVI.‚ ἓξ 71——72 describes how the guilty man
was sewn up naked in a leather sack and cast into a
running stream to drown. From another of his writings
and from Justinian's Pandects we gather further particu-
lars ; that the parricide’s head was bound up in a bag of
wolf’s skin‚ and that wooden sandals were bound on his
feet—presumably to symbolise that he was unfit to
breathe the air or touch the earth—*after which he was
kept in solitary confinement till the sack was ready.
Then he was first scourged with scarlet rods, after which
he was sewn into a leather sack into which were placed
a dog, a cock, a viper and an ape, all of which, we must
infer, conveyed to the Roman mind suggestions associa-
ted with unnatural or inhuman instincts. It is some
satisfaction, however, to know that the penalty was
rarely inflicted and only after a confession of guilt.
